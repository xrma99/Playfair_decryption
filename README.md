# Playfair_decryption in Cryptography Course
A project decrypting the ciphertext using **playfair** method.

To analyze the key, we can count the frequency of each letter pair and compare it with official statistics.

For the *Playfair_2.txt*, the key is **HISTORY**.

For the *Playfair_0.txt*, the key is **ALGEBR**.

Because time has been so long, I already forget the key for *Playfair_1.txt*.
